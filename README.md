## Plan for This Year

This year I will be using Go once again, but in an effort to do something
different I will be using [GitHub codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces)
in order to see how well it works for someone who likes to work in the command
line. 

I'll be using the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) in order to connect with
my codespace (using SSH) and have a [dotfiles configuration](https://github.com/devries/dotfiles)
which installs my preferred editor ([Neovim](https://neovim.io/)) and tmux so
I can work comfortably. I should be able to stick to the free tier (60 hours of
usage and 15 GB-months storage) for Advent of Code, but should give me enough
time to see if working through codespaces is something that I enjoy. The big
down side is likely to be the delay caused by working over an SSH connection. I
am not a big fan of Neovim's remote editing feature, so I plan to run Neovim
on the remote codespace.

It seems like cloud-hosted development environments are becoming more common, so
I look forward to seeing how this experiment pans out.
